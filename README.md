VendingMachine Kata


Lets start with an simple version implementation and grow from it.


# Notes:

## Some assumptions made:

- Like in a real vending machine if the coin inserted isn't valid, and was able to put it inside, it will be returned immediately


# TODO

Setup a VendingMachine class with the basic funcionality I/O (Simple version to construct from) 

- [x] Insert Coin
- [x] Coin Validation
- [ ] Return money
- [ ] Sell Items
